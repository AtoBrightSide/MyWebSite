                I like playing football, listening to music
                and taking long quiet walks on the beach (
                joking on the last part). That is what I do
                when I'm not developing amazing Websites and
                Web applications and also various games and 
                short-movies.
                You can guess from my rather vivid description
                that I am a software engineer. Well, not yet, 
                I'm still a student, 2nd year to be precise, 
                but that wont stop me from doing what I love...

                    This is a personal website that I have designed myself using only HTML. Even though
                    it has been somewhat difficult, I handled the challenge...besides, someone smart once said: 
                    "Life is full of challenge".
                    I have included my reviews on books I've read, places I've visited and my family.
