                </details>
                <pre><li><strong>The Godfather by Mario Puzo(9/10):</strong> an all time classic novel, it is one of my all-time favorite books. I read it in 
                   highschool and it taught me how important composure is when you're faced with tough odds</li> </pre><br>

                <pre><li><strong>Tell Me your Dreams by Sydney Sheldon(7/10)</strong>: a suspensful thriller revolving around a woman on trial. As with most of this
                    author's works, <i>Tell me your dreams</i> gives the impression of women being mistreated and yet they still manage to cope.<br> </li></pre><br>

                <pre><li><strong>Master of the Game by Sydney Sheldon(8.5/10)</strong>: this is my first Sydney Sheldon book, 
                    and I really recommend you start with this if you haven't read any of his previous works. 
                    Its a generation crossing family drama about managing an Empire</li></pre><br>
               
                <pre><li><strong>The Third Twin by Ken Follet(8/10)</strong>: a masterpiece. If you have some work to do or some 
                    deadline to meet dont start this book, because you wont be able to eat, 
                    drink or rest before you finish this book. I'm serious..its a true page-turner.</li></pre> <br>
                
                <pre><li><strong>A Dangerous Fortune by Ken Follet(7/10)</strong>: set in 19th century England, <i>A Danegrous Fortune</i>
                     is set around the falling of a family-run bank. It shows the struggles a young
                    man faces to grow in his workplace, the nepotism at that time and his social life.</li></pre> <br>
                
                <pre><li><strong>The Winner stands alone Paolo Coelho(5/10)</strong>: interesting book. Although not as meaningful
                    as his other works...still hooks you as soon as you begin reading it. It keeps making you 
                    guess what happens next.</pre> <br>
                
                <pre><li><strong>Elantris by Brandon Sanderson(6/10)</strong>: this is the first fantasy book I've read in a while,
                     and to be honest, its not bad. If you haven't read any fantasy books before, I think
                    you would get confused a bit at first, but its nothing you wont get used to...
                    </li></pre> <br>
                
                <pre><li><strong>The Couple Next Door by by Shari Lapena(6/10)</strong>: a thriller, its a relatively small book, I 
                    finished it in abt two days. I had never heard of Shari Lapena before, but after this book I
                    look for her name everytime I enter a bookstore.
                </li></pre> <br>
                
                <pre><li><strong>The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Duma(7/10)</strong>: I enjoyed it. Its a long book that ultimately 
                    teaches one lesson : Revenge. Now deciding whether revenge is a positive or negative emotion 
                    is a tough one, which is why I leave the reader to settle it for themselves </li></pre> <br>
                
                <pre><li><strong>Caravans by James Michener(7.25/10)</strong>: an absolute stunner..it gives you a feel about Afghanistan
                    during that time(1940's). The description of the land and the people is very authentic, since 
                    Michener went there prior to writing the book to do some research.</li></pre> <br>
