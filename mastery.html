            Three years ago, I read a book called Mastery by American Author Robert Greene. This <br> 
            ended up changing my whole outlook on life. I have been more productive and outgoing <br>
            ever since then. Now this might not mean that the book changed me completely, but it is<br>
            important to understand how the book makes readers open their brain to endless possibilities.

Every man holds his fortune in his own hands, like a sculptor the raw material he 
will fashion into a figure. But it's the same with that type of artistic activity 
as with all others: We are merely born with the capability to do it. The skill to
mold the material into what we want must be learned and attentively cultivated.</cite>

            Green calls this skill, <i>Mastery</i>. Over the centuries, people have placed a wall around<br>
            such mastery. It has been given many names..genius, wizardly and even cursed. It was <br>
            considered to be achieved either through birth or by some sort of witchcraft. But this wall <br> 
            doesnt exist. The brain that we possess is the work of 6 million years of development, and<br>
            more than anything else, this evolution of the brain was designed to lead us to mastert, the <br> 
            latent power within us all.
    </p>
    <p>
        The book mentions various characters that the author considers "Masters" of their fields. And while <br>
        reading I have found these people somewhat inspirational as their stories of development is worth <br> 
        learning from. <br> <br>
        <h3>Discovering one's Calling</h3>
        To explain how we do that, the first person he mentions is Leonardo Da Vinci. <br> 
        The following is a direct text taken from Mastery;<br>
        <pre><strong><i>
            One time, as part of his studio work, he was asked to paint an angel in a larger
            biblical scene designed by Verrocchio. He had decided that he would make his portion
            of the scene come to life in his own way. In the foreground in front of the angel he
            painted a flowerbed, but instead of the usual generalized renderings of plants, 
            Leonardo depicted the flower specimens that he had studied in such detail as a child,
            with a kind of scientific rigor no one had seen before. For the angel’s face, he 
            experimented with his paints and mixed a new blend that gave it a kind of soft radiance
            that expressed the angel’s sublime mood. (To help capture this mood, Leonardo had spent 
            time in the local church observing those in fervent prayer, the expression of one young
            man serving as the model for the angel.) And finally, he determined that he would be the 
            first artist to create realistic angelic wings.

        Alas that is the question, how do I find the things that enthrall me? Well, the book gives some strategies to <br>
        find this "calling";

        <h3>Playing to your Strengths: Supreme Focus</h3>
        <p>
            Haven't you ever felt like you couldn't focus in class? Or you couldn't get a job done on time? <br>
            Well, just wanted to let you know that you are not the only one. And one person that felt like you <br>
            was Albert Einstein. <br> <br>
        </p>
        <pre><strong><i>
            It took longer than usual for little Albert to talk, and his first attempts at language were
            always so halting. He had a strange habit of muttering the words to himself before he said them
            out loud. These problems continued through his way through school. He was not a particularly
            good student either, he hated having to memorize facts and numbers, he hated the stern authority
            of the teachers and his grades were mediocre so, concerned for his future, his parents decided to
            send him to a more liberal school. At that school, there were no drills or facts to memorize; 
            instead, the method placed supreme importance on visual forms of intelligence.
            In this atmosphere, Einstein suddenly thrived. He found the place intensly stimulating. He
            delved more deeply into the Newtonian concept of the universe that deeply troubled him and 
            caused him many sleepless nights.
            Some years later, Einstein entered th eZurich Polytechnic Institute, and once again his dislike 
            for traditional schooling returned. He did not do particulary well in math, he hated the way
            physics was taught, he wasn't a promising student, and had not attracted any attention from the 
            professors. 
            A year later, he came to a life-changing decision about himself: He was not an experimental 
            scientist, but his strengths were solving abstract puzzles of any kind using his natural disdain
            for authority, he could think in ways that were flexible. This would mean that he would not fit in
            the world of academia. This was when he decided that he would have to find his own path.

        <p>
            This shows that there are many paths to mastery, and if you are persistent you will find one that <br>
            suits you. But a key element that needs to be remembered is dertermining your strengths and working <br>
            with them.<br> 
            Greene says that to rise to the level of mastery, requires many hours of dedicated focus. You must <br>
            look deep within and come to an understanding of these particular strengths and weaknesses you possess, <br>
            being realistic as possible. In this way, your creative and intuitive powers will be naturally awakened. <br>

        <h3>Strategies for Completing the Ideal Apprenticeship</h3>
        <p>
            Throughout history, Masters in all fields have devised for themselves various strategies to help them pursue <br>
            and complete an Ideal Apprenticeship. Out of these strategies I have picked one which has spoken to me individualy <br> <br>
            <h4>Trust the Process</h4>
            <pre><strong><i>
                One morning in 1978, during his sophomore year, Cesar Rodriguez's roommate told him that he was going to take the
                exams that the army, navy and airforce were offering for entrance into the aviation branches of their forces. He 
                decided to come along and take the exams just for the hell of it. To his surprise, he was notified that he had been 
                accepted for their pilot training program. Eventually, after graduating from his school in 1981, he was sent to the 
                ten-month pilot instruction school at Vance Air Force base in Oklahoma. 
                
                At Vance, however, he discovered that he was suddenly in over his head. Now they were training on a subsonic jet, 
                the T-37. He had to wear a ten-pound helmet and a forty-pound parachute on his back. The cockpit was unbearably small
                and hot. The instructor sat uncomfortably close in the seat beside him, observing his every move. The stress of performing,
                the heat, the physical pressures of flying at such speeds would make him sweat profusely and shake. He felt as though
                the jet itself was pounding and beating him as he flew. And then there were so many more variables to be aware of in
                flying a jet.

                Much to his dismay, several months into training he received failing marks on two consecutive flights, and was benched 
                from flying for an entire week. He had never failed at anything before; it was a matter of pride that he had conquered 
                everything that had been presented to him so far in life. Now he faced a possibility that would devastate him. Seventy 
                students had started out in the course, but almost every week one of them was cut from the program. It was a ruthless, 
                whittling-down process. It looked as if he would be the next one to be cut, and such cuts were final. Once he was 
                allowed back into the plane, he would only have a few chances to prove himself. He had already been trying his hardest.
                Where had he gone wrong? Perhaps unconsciously, he had become intimidated and afraid of the flying process itself. Now
                he was more afraid of failing.

                What was necessary was to trust the process and the results that would come from more practice. This would have to be the
                way forward in his current situation.

                He tripled his time with the simulator, habituating his mind to the sensation of so many stimuli. He spent his off-hours 
                visualizing himself in the cockpit, repeating the maneuvers he was weakest at. Once he was allowed back in the plane, 
                he focused much harder, knowing he would have to make the most of each precious session. Whenever there was a chance to 
                have more air time, for instance when another student was sick, he grabbed it. Slowly, day by day, he found a way to calm 
                himself in the pilot seat and get a better handle on all of the complex operations. In the two weeks after being allowed 
                back into the plane, he had managed to rescue his position for the time being; he was now ranked somewhere in the middle 
                of the group.
                <img src="./assets/images/cesar.jpg" alt="" title="the last ace getting into cockpit">
                With ten weeks remaining in the program, Rodriguez took stock of the situation. He had come too far not to succeed. He 
                enjoyed the challenge, he loved flying, and now what he wanted more than anything in life was to become a fighter pilot. 
                That would mean graduating from the program near the very top. Among his group were several “golden boys”—young men who 
                had a natural flair for flying. They not only handled the intense pressures, they fed off of them. He was the opposite of 
                a golden boy, but that had been the story of his life. He had succeeded through his determination before, and now it would 
                have to be the same. 

                One day, however, as he was flying the T-38, Rodriguez had a strange and wonderful sensation—it seemed like he could feel the 
                plane itself at the edge of his fingertips. This is how it must be for the golden boys, he thought, 
                only for him it had taken nearly ten months of intense training. His mind no longer felt mired in all of the details. It was 
                vague, but he could sense the possibility of a higher way of thinking—seeing the larger picture of flying in formation, while 
                also commanding the complex operations in the cockpit. This sensation would come and go, but the feeling made all of the work 
                worthwhile.

            What separates Masters from others is simple. Whenever we are learning a new skill, we reach a point of frustration-what we are <br>
            learning seems beyond our capabilities. Among the dozens of pilots who did not make it, all of them had the same talent level. <br>
            The difference is not just a matter of determination, but more of trust and faith. <br>
            When it comes to mastering a skill, time is the secret ingredient. Assuming your practice is proceeding accordingly, over a couple <br> 
            of weeks some elements of the skill become hard-wired. It is an amazing sensation, and practice will get you there no matter how <br>
            talented you are.The only real impediments are your emotions..you should not suppress any type of emotion...for they are normal and <br>
            are experienced by the Masters as well. <br>
            The frustration is a sign of progress..and you should trust that progress is a part of the learning process.
