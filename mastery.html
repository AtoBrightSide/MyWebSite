            Three years ago, I read a book called Mastery by American Author Robert Greene. This <br> 
            ended up changing my whole outlook on life. I have been more productive and outgoing <br>
            ever since then. Now this might not mean that the book changed me completely, but it is<br>
            important to understand how the book makes readers open their brain to endless possibilities. <br><br>

Every man holds his fortune in his own hands, like a sculptor the raw material he 
will fashion into a figure. But it's the same with that type of artistic activity 
as with all others: We are merely born with the capability to do it. The skill to
mold the material into what we want must be learned and attentively cultivated.

            Green calls this skill, <i>Mastery</i>. Over the centuries, people have placed a wall around<br>
            such mastery. It has been given many names..genius, wizardly and even cursed. It was <br>
            considered to be achieved either through birth or by some sort of witchcraft. But this wall <br> 
            doesnt exist. The brain that we possess is the work of 6 million years of development, and<br>
            more than anything else, this evolution of the brain was designed to lead us to mastert, the <br> 
            latent power within us all.

        The book mentions various characters that the author considers "Masters" of their fields. And while <br>
        reading I have found these people somewhat inspirational as their stories of development is worth <br> 
        learning from. <br> <br>
        <h4>Discovering one's Calling</h4>
        To explain how we do that, the first person he mentions is Leonardo Da Vinci. <br> 
        The following is a direct text taken from Mastery;<br>
        <pre><strong><i>
            One time, as part of his studio work, he was asked to paint an angel in a larger
            biblical scene designed by Verrocchio. He had decided that he would make his portion
            of the scene come to life in his own way. In the foreground in front of the angel he
            painted a flowerbed, but instead of the usual generalized renderings of plants, 
            Leonardo depicted the flower specimens that he had studied in such detail as a child,
            with a kind of scientific rigor no one had seen before. For the angel’s face, he 
            experimented with his paints and mixed a new blend that gave it a kind of soft radiance
            that expressed the angel’s sublime mood. (To help capture this mood, Leonardo had spent 
            time in the local church observing those in fervent prayer, the expression of one young
            man serving as the model for the angel.) And finally, he determined that he would be the 
            first artist to create realistic angelic wings.

        Alas that is the question, how do I find the things that enthrall me? Well, the book gives some strategies to <br>
        find this "calling";
